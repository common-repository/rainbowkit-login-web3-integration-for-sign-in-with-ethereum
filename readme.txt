2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.

Using an Infura ID/API key is required to use most features in this plugin, including token-gating and role mapping. You can [sign up for a free account here](https://infura.io/). The free tier is sufficient for most use cases. If you're using this plugin for a production site, you'll want to [sign up for a paid account](https://infura.io/pricing) to avoid rate limiting.

Supplying your own WalletConnect Project ID is also highly recommended. You can [sign up for a free project ID from WallectConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/).
